Fast Power

Problem Description

Given two positive integers A and B. Implement Fast Power function to compute AB

Note : Please use the approach taught in the class.



Problem Constraints

AB would fit in 64-bit type integer.


Input Format

Two integers A and B


Output Format

Single integer denoting the answer to AB


Example Input

Input 1 :
A = 2 , B = 10
Input 2 :
A = 1 , B = 100000000


Example Output

Output 1 :
1024
Output 2 :
1


Example Explanation

For Input 1 :
210 = 25 * 25 
25 = 32, so 32 * 32 = 1024
For Input 2 :
1 raised to power anything is 1
